# drumgizmo-edrum-settings
Settings for your electronic drumkit to use it as input device for Drumgizmo.

## Supported devices
* Roland TD-4

## Usage
Just download the midimap file for your e-drumkit and load it into Drumgizmo.

It may be necessary to tweak your MIDI settings in your TD-4 module a bit to get a good sound. 
I will post mine if I am fully satisfied.
